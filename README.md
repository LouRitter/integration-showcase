# Obligo Integration Showcase

This repository demonstrates technical skills relevant to the Partnership Implementation Engineer role at Obligo. Each folder contains a mini-project simulating key integration tasks using mocked APIs, fake data, and documented flows.

## Projects Overview

1. **API Renter Session** — Simulates Obligo's renter session flow using mock REST endpoints.
2. **Webhook Receiver** — Webhook listener with retry simulation and payload logging.
3. **Data Sync Simulator** — Mimics syncing tenant data from PMS to Obligo format.
4. **Implementation Playbook** — Markdown guide + diagrams for integration planning.
5. **Frontend Snippet** — A basic client-side simulation of Obligo session UI integration.

> ⚠️ All APIs and data are mocked or simulated. No real credentials or endpoints are used.

Each subfolder contains instructions, sample payloads, and code examples. I hope you like it, and I look forward to the interview process!
