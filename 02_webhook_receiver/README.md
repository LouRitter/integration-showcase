# Webhook Receiver

## What are Webhooks?

Webhooks are a way for applications to send real-time data to other systems. They work by making HTTP POST requests to a specified URL whenever a specific event occurs. This allows systems to communicate and trigger actions without requiring constant polling.

## About `/server.py`

The `server.py` script in this project acts as a webhook receiver. It sets up a simple HTTP server to listen for incoming webhook requests. When a webhook is received, the script processes the data and performs the necessary actions based on the event.

### Key Features:
- Listens for HTTP POST requests on a specified endpoint.
- Parses and logs the incoming webhook payload.
- Can be extended to handle specific events or trigger workflows.

### How to Use:
1. Start the server by running `server.py`.
2. Configure the webhook sender to point to the server's URL.
3. Monitor the logs to see incoming webhook data.
